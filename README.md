##Day1 
1. How to clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Create .gitignore file so that your virtual environment doesn't get push in remote github
4. Create setup.py to make this application as a generic package, also find_packages will look for all the files which contains __int__.py to make it package . We have created src for that matter.
5. For installed packages use requirements.txt instead of writing all the packages in list
6. If we will use -e . in requirements.txt at the end line it will automatically trigger setup.py
